# UFOs

## Project involved refactoring app.js (JavaScript) and index.html files to search 
## and display UFO data while using up to 5 different search parameters.

### The inputs parameters to the 5 search functions are:

    * Date
    * City
    * State
    * Country
    * Shape

### Searches of the UFO data.js file can apply 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 functions.



    * The app.js file takes in the search parameters from the index.html webpage & outputs unfiltered/filtered searches.
    * The index.html file creates a webpage that takes in search parameters & displays the resulting UFO sightings.
    * A style.css file applies formatting functions that enhance the appearance of the webpage.
    * The challenge JavaScript file is called: app.js
    * The challenge html file is called: index.html
